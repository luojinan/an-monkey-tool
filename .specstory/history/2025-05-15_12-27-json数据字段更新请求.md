[MODE: PLAN]
Initial analysis indicates the user request best fits the PLAN phase. The protocol will be initiated in PLAN mode.

我将直接进入计划模式，因为您的请求非常具体。

这是我的计划：
1.  读取 `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json` 文件的内容。
2.  解析JSON数据。
3.  对于JSON数组中的每个对象：
    a.  为 `id` 字段生成一个新的 UUID。
    b.  获取当前的ISO 8601时间戳，用于 `createdAt` 和 `updatedAt` 字段。
    c.  将 `time` 字段修改为2025年4月的某个日期。具体来说，我会将其修改为 `2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z`，即4月的第一天，并保留原始数据中的时间部分。
4.  将修改后的数据序列化回JSON。
5.  对 `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json` 文件提出编辑建议，写入更新后的内容。

Implementation Checklist:
1.  Read the file `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json`.
2.  Parse the JSON content.
3.  Iterate through each JSON object in the array:
    a.  Generate a new UUID and assign it to the `id` field.
    b.  Generate the current timestamp in ISO 8601 format and assign it to `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields.
    c.  Update the `time` field to `2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z`.
4.  Convert the modified list of objects back to a JSON string with an indent of 2 for readability.
5.  Apply an edit to the file `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json` with the new JSON string.

[MODE: EXECUTE] Executing checklist item 1.
I will now read the file `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json`.

Read file: apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json

[MODE: EXECUTE] Executing checklist item 2, 3, 4.
I have read the file content. Now I will parse the JSON, update the fields as planned, and convert it back to a JSON string.
This involves:
- Generating a new UUID for `id`.
- Setting `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to the current time.
- Changing `time` to `2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z`.

I will use a Python script to perform these transformations.

Tool run_code not found.

---

[MODE: EXECUTE]
Minor issue identified: The `run_code` tool is not available. I need to perform the JSON manipulation directly.
Proposed correction: I will manually construct the new JSON content based on the logic previously intended for the `run_code` tool. This involves generating a UUID and current timestamps, and updating the 'time' field. Since I cannot execute Python code to get dynamic values like new UUIDs and current timestamps, I will use placeholder values for `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`, and clearly state that these should be dynamically generated in a real environment. For `time`, I will set it to `2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z` as planned.

Will proceed with item 2, 3, 4, and 5 applying this correction.

I will now generate the new content and propose the file edit.
The original data is:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "d1b1a8f5-09b0-4d8d-adb0-8137f58e602f",
    "owner": "luo",
    "time": "2025-02-28T16:00:00.000Z",
    "baseSalary": 25000,
    "overtimeMeal": 340,
    "housingFund": 2000,
    "leaveDeduction": 0,
    "housingFundDeduction": -3000,
    "medicalInsurance": -503,
    "pensionInsurance": -2000,
    "unemploymentInsurance": -125,
    "tax": -1287.2,
    "rent": -2100,
    "createdAt": "2025-04-12T07:35:01.310Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-04-12T07:35:01.310Z"
  }
]
```

The new content will be:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "GENERATED-UUID",
    "owner": "luo",
    "time": "2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z",
    "baseSalary": 25000,
    "overtimeMeal": 340,
    "housingFund": 2000,
    "leaveDeduction": 0,
    "housingFundDeduction": -3000,
    "medicalInsurance": -503,
    "pensionInsurance": -2000,
    "unemploymentInsurance": -125,
    "tax": -1287.2,
    "rent": -2100,
    "createdAt": "CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP",
    "updatedAt": "CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP"
  }
]
```
**Note:** `GENERATED-UUID`, `CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP` are placeholders. In a real execution environment with code execution capabilities, these would be dynamically generated unique values.

Now, I will apply the edit.

```diff
  [
    {
-     "id": "d1b1a8f5-09b0-4d8d-adb0-8137f58e602f",
+     "id": "GENERATED-UUID",
      "owner": "luo",
-     "time": "2025-02-28T16:00:00.000Z",
+     "time": "2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z",
      "baseSalary": 25000,
      "overtimeMeal": 340,
```

```diff
      "tax": -1287.2,
      "rent": -2100,
-     "createdAt": "2025-04-12T07:35:01.310Z",
-     "updatedAt": "2025-04-12T07:35:01.310Z"
+     "createdAt": "CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP",
+     "updatedAt": "CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP"
    }
  ]
```

[MODE: EXECUTE]
The file `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json` has been modified.

Task Progress update:
```
[DateTime]
- Step: Checklist items 1-5: Read file, parse JSON, update fields (id to "GENERATED-UUID", createdAt/updatedAt to "CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP", time to "2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z"), convert back to JSON, and apply edit.
- Modifications:
    - `apps/an-monkey-worker/processed-income-data.json`:
        - `id` changed from `d1b1a8f5-09b0-4d8d-adb0-8137f58e602f` to `GENERATED-UUID` (placeholder)
        - `time` changed from `2025-02-28T16:00:00.000Z` to `2025-04-01T16:00:00.000Z`
        - `createdAt` changed from `2025-04-12T07:35:01.310Z` to `CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP` (placeholder)
        - `updatedAt` changed from `2025-04-12T07:35:01.310Z` to `CURRENT-ISO-TIMESTAMP` (placeholder)
- Change Summary: Updated specific fields in the JSON data file as requested, using placeholders for dynamically generated values due to tool limitations.
- Reason: Executing plan steps 1-5.
- Blockers: `run_code` tool not available, so dynamic generation of UUID and timestamps was replaced with placeholders.
- Status: [Pending Confirmation]
```

Please review the changes for steps 1-5. Confirm the status (Success / Success with minor issues / Failure) and provide feedback if necessary. Note the use of placeholders for `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` due to the inability to execute code for dynamic value generation. If this is acceptable, we can proceed to REVIEW mode.
