# 发布更新后的worker (2025-04-12 15:54:29)

更新了worker，如何发布

---

_**Assistant**_

我看到您想要发布更新后的 worker。根据您的 `wrangler.jsonc` 配置文件和错误信息，我来帮您解决这个问题。

首先，让我们检查一下当前目录结构：


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory apps/an-monkey-worker • **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `wrangler.jsonc` |
| 📄 `processed-income-data.json` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `.env` |
| 📄 `prisma.config.ts` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `.wrangler` |
| 📁 `migrations` |
| 📄 `worker-configuration.d.ts` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📁 `prisma` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |

</details>

---

我看到您使用的是 pnpm 和 Wrangler。要发布 worker，您需要：

1. 首先确保您在正确的目录下：


---

```bash
cd apps/an-monkey-worker
```

```
luo@Rocky-deMacBook-Pro an-monkey-worker % 

```

---

2. 然后使用 Wrangler 发布 worker：



---

```bash
pnpm wrangler deploy
```

```

看起来我们需要在 `wrangler.jsonc` 中启用 `nodejs_compat` 标志。让我修改配置文件：



---

```diff
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-03-17",
+   "compatibility_flags": [
+     "nodejs_compat"
+   ],
    "d1_databases": [
      {
```

```diff
      }
    ]
-   // "compatibility_flags": [
-   //   "nodejs_compat"
-   // ],
    // "vars": {
    //   "MY_VAR": "my-variable"
```

---

现在让我们再次尝试部署：



---

```bash
pnpm wrangler deploy
```

```

 ⛅️ wrangler 4.10.0
-------------------

Total Upload: 4447.22 KiB / gzip: 1304.05 KiB
Worker Startup Time: 30 ms
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- D1 Databases:
  - DB: an-monkey-db (424b8698-0f13-4803-8bbd-f865009dc87b)
Uploaded an-monkey-worker (7.06 sec)
Deployed an-monkey-worker triggers (0.45 sec)
  https://an-monkey-worker.kingan233.workers.dev
Current Version ID: 434512ae-e0a3-4430-b15b-29089c35eac7

```

---

太好了！Worker 已经成功部署了。您可以通过以下 URL 访问它：
https://an-monkey-worker.kingan233.workers.dev

部署过程完成了以下几个步骤：
1. 上传了所有必要的文件（总大小约 4.4MB，gzip 压缩后约 1.3MB）
2. Worker 启动时间为 30ms
3. 成功绑定了 D1 数据库
4. 部署完成，并生成了新的版本 ID：434512ae-e0a3-4430-b15b-29089c35eac7

您现在可以开始使用这个 Worker 了。如果需要进行任何更改，只需修改代码后再次运行 `pnpm wrangler deploy` 即可更新部署。
